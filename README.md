Project Abstract
Topic: Wireless transfer of display data from Laptops, Tablets etc.. to the Projector.
Problem / Motivation Statement : The difficulty in using a wired VGA cord to connect the projector and the laptops or tablets etc.. by different people for presentation, hassle in movement with the                         device around, more time consumed in connecting the cords on both ends.
Methods / Approach : 
We have thought of making this process wireless. So, currently we have got two different wireless approaches:
1. First the very basic way of doing this, by using a VGA to RF signal module connected to the PC, that transmits the Display data & the other end, thats the projector side with another RF to VGA module, that receives the PC display signal, which would be converted to VGA signal to the projector.
2. This is a bit complicated, as we would be using wide variety of technology in this concept. The idea is to make a Wi­Fi Module that's connected to the projector, either through a VGA or S Video or USB port of the projector. So as soon as the projector is turned on, the Wi­Fi module starts broadcasting an ad hoc network or is connected to a wireless network through a router. Any Wi­Fi enabled Device could be connected to the Wi­Fi Module through secure authentications process right, in https site of the Wi­Fi module. As the client system accepts the protocols, through cloud computing technology, the system drivers are identified & configured, so that the system is ready to send its Display data through its Wi­Fi console. The sent data is received by the Wi­Fi Module & is converted into required format for projection.
